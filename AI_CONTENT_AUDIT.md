**Found on your site:**
- ✅ "testament" (About page)
- ✅ "delve" / "delving" 
- ✅ "underscore" / "underscores"
- ✅ "leverage" / "leveraging"
- ✅ "cutting-edge" / "state-of-the-art"

### 2. **Corporate Buzzword Overload** (Hero + Services)
**Found:**
- "Professional IT infrastructure and AI solutions for businesses that want to move faster."
- "Enterprise-grade wireless networks"
- "Optimize network and Wi-Fi infrastructure"

**Fix:** Be specific and concrete:
- ❌ "move faster" → ✅ "stop losing customers to missed calls"
- ❌ "enterprise-grade" → ✅ "WiFi that works in your warehouse"
- ❌ "optimize infrastructure" → ✅ "fix your dead zones"

---

### 3. **Vapid Transition Phrases** (Throughout)
**Found:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "As technology continues to evolve..."
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
- "It's important to note that..."

**Fix:** Cut these entirely or replace with:
- "Here's the thing:"
- "Truth is:"
- "The reality:"
- Or just **delete** and start with the point

---

### 4. **Binary Contrast Phrases** (Services page)
**Found:**
- "It's not about X, it's about Y" patterns
- "Forget everything you know about..."

**Fix:** These scream AI. Remove or rewrite genuinely.

---

### 5. **Signposting Overload** (Process sections)
**Found:**
- "And the best part?"
- "Here's the breakdown"
- "Here's what you need to know"

**Fix:** These are AI training artifacts. Remove entirely.

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES

### 6. **Hyper-Scannable Formatting** (All pages)
**Found:**
- Every section has H2/H3 headings
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Overuse of **bold** and lists
- Question-based headers

**Fix:** 
- Add some longer paragraphs (5-7 sentences)
- Remove some headings—let content flow
- Use bold sparingly (1-2 per section max)
- Write statement headers, not questions

---

### 7. **Bullet Point Addiction** (Services, Features)
**Found:**
- Lists of exactly 3-5 items everywhere
- All bullets start with verbs
- No complex hierarchies

**Fix:** 
- Vary list lengths (2, 4, 6 items)
- Mix bullet styles (not all verb-led)
- Use paragraphs instead of lists sometimes

---

### 8. **Uniform Sentence Rhythm** (About page)
**Found:**
- Sentences: 12-20 words consistently
- Predictable punctuation
- No variation in length

**Fix:** 
- Add short punchy sentences. Like this.
- Then follow with a longer, more complex sentence that provides detail and context.
- Mix it up.

---

### 9. **Lack of Personal Perspective** (About page)
**Found:**
- "Your problem is my priority" (generic)
- "I answer my phone" (says every IT guy)
- No specific stories or failures

**Fix:** Add specific details:
- ❌ "I learned by doing" → ✅ "I spent 3 weekends straight fixing a network crash for a church—learned more those 72 hours than any certification"
- ❌ "budgets are tight" → ✅ "When you've got $200 to secure a 50-person office, you get creative"

---

### 10. **Perfect Grammar Syndrome**
**Found:**
- No contractions ("it is" instead of "it's")
- No typos or casual language
- Overly polished

**Fix:** 
- Use contractions: "it's", "don't", "can't"
- Allow minor imperfections (it's more human)
- Write like you talk, not like you write a report

---

## 🟢 LOWER PRIORITY (Visual/Design)

### 11. **Stock Photo Feel** (Pixel portrait is good, but...)
**Status:** Your pixel art is actually unique—keep it!

### 12. **Generic Service Descriptions**
**Found:**
- "24/7 call answering with natural AI voices"
- "HD & 4K camera systems"
- "Remote mobile access"

**Fix:** Make them specific:
- "Your AI answers at 2 AM when you're asleep"
